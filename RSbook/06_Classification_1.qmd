# Classification I

## Summary

This lecture covered **classification methods** in remote sensing, particularly **supervised and unsupervised classification**. Classification is essential in spatial analysis as it helps extract meaningful information from satellite imagery.

### **Supervised Classification**

Supervised classification relies on labeled training data to categorize pixels. Common methods include:

-   **Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC):** Assumes a normal distribution of data and assigns each pixel to the class with the highest probability.

-   **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Identifies an optimal decision boundary between different classes.

-   **Random Forest (RF):** A machine learning approach using multiple decision trees for classification.

### **Unsupervised Classification**

Unsupervised classification groups pixels into clusters based on spectral properties without predefined labels. Common methods include:

-   **K-Means Clustering:** Iteratively assigns pixels to K clusters by minimizing variance.

-   **ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis):** Allows merging and splitting of clusters for more flexibility.

This method is useful when ground truth data is unavailable, but class labels must be assigned afterward.

### **Mixed Pixels and Challenges**

-   **Mixed Pixels:** A single pixel may contain multiple land cover types, affecting classification accuracy.

-   **Solutions:** Spectral unmixing and increasing spatial resolution can help mitigate this issue.

## Applications

Remote sensing classification have significantly enhanced land cover mapping and environmental monitoring capabilities.

Kussul et al. [-@kussul2017deep] developed an innovative deep learning framework combining unsupervised and supervised neural networks for crop type classification in Ukraine. Their multilevel architecture processes multitemporal Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A data, achieving over 85% accuracy in distinguishing five major crop types. The study demonstrated CNNs' superior performance compared to traditional multilayer perceptrons, particularly in differentiating spectrally similar crops like maize and soybeans. The integrated unsupervised component effectively handles cloud cover and missing data, while the supervised ensemble improves classification robustness in heterogeneous agricultural areas.

Billah et al. [-@billah2023random] implemented a random forest classifier for flood damage assessment in northeast Bangladesh, utilizing combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Their methodology achieved 90% accuracy in land cover classification, significantly outperforming conventional maximum likelihood methods (74% accuracy). The research highlighted SAR data's value for reliable flood mapping during monsoons, complemented by optical data for detailed land cover baselines. The study quantified substantial agricultural impacts, with 23.98% of cropland inundated during monsoon floods and 72.41% affected by flash floods, providing critical data for disaster response planning in ecologically sensitive wetland regions.

## Reflection

This lecture deepened my understanding of classification techniques in remote sensing, particularly the differences between supervised and unsupervised approaches. I found it fascinating how these methods allow us to extract valuable information from satellite imagery, helping researchers analyze land use patterns, environmental changes, and disaster impacts.

One aspect that stood out to me was the challenge of **mixed pixels**, where a single pixel contains multiple land cover types. This issue highlights the limitations of spatial resolution and the importance of advanced techniques like spectral unmixing. It made me think about how classification accuracy depends not only on the algorithm but also on data quality, resolution, and preprocessing methods.

The applications of classification in disaster management also intrigued me. I had not fully realized the extent to which satellite-based classification supports emergency response efforts, such as flood mapping. This connects to my group research on Manchesterâ€™s flooding problem, where classification techniques could help analyze historical flood patterns and identify high-risk areas.
