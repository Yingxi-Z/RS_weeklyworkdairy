# Remote Sensing Data

## Summary

### Correction of Remote Sensing Data

#### Geometric Correction

-   **Problem**: Image positions don't match actual geographic locations
-   **Causes**:
    -   Earth curvature effects
    -   Sensor viewing angle deviations
    -   Platform attitude variations (satellite/aircraft movement)
-   **Correction Process**:
    -   Ground Control Points (GCPs): Identify corresponding points between image and real ground
    -   Transformation Model: Calculate correction formulas (typically polynomial)
    -   Resampling: Assign values to new grid
        -   Nearest Neighbor: Preserves original values, suitable for classified data
        -   Bilinear Interpolation: Averages values, produces smoother results
        -   Cubic Convolution: High quality but computationally intensive

#### Atmospheric Correction

-   **Problem**: Atmospheric gases and particles interfere with signal transmission
    -   Scattering: Changes light direction, increases path radiance
    -   Absorption: Weakens signal strength at specific wavelengths
-   **Correction Methods**:
    -   Dark Object Subtraction (DOS): Assumes brightness in dark areas comes from atmospheric scattering
    -   Radiative Transfer Code: Uses physical models to simulate and remove atmospheric effects
    -   Empirical Line Correction: Establishes empirical relationships using ground measurements
    -   Second-Order Derivative: Reduces background interference in spectral curves
-   **Practical Advice**: DOS suitable for beginners, radiative transfer models recommended for professional analysis

#### Orthorectification

-   Special type of geometric correction that eliminates displacement caused by terrain
-   Requires DEM data to calculate actual position of each pixel
-   Generates orthoimages with uniform scale for direct measurement

#### Reflectance Correction

-   Conversion from Digital Numbers (DN) to physical values
-   Steps include:
    -   Radiometric calibration: DN to radiance
    -   Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance: Accounts for solar illumination
    -   Surface reflectance: After atmospheric correction
-   Essential for quantitative analysis and multi-temporal comparisons

### Data Mosaicking

-   Combines multiple images into a seamless large-area image
-   **Processing Steps**:
    -   Precise registration of adjacent images
    -   Radiometric balancing to eliminate color differences
    -   Seamline optimization to avoid obvious features
    -   Edge blending to eliminate visible seams

### Enhancement and Analysis of Remote Sensing Data

#### Image Enhancement Techniques

-   **Contrast Stretching**: Expands histogram to enhance feature distinctiveness
-   **Filtering**:
    -   Low-pass filters: Smooth noise
    -   High-pass filters: Enhance edges
-   **Band Combinations**: Highlight specific features through different band combinations
-   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimension reduction while preserving key information
-   **Texture Analysis**: Extracts information about spatial arrangement patterns

#### Remote Sensing Indices

-   **Vegetation Indices**:
    -   NDVI = (NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red): Reflects vegetation vigor
    -   EVI: Improved NDVI, reduces soil background effects
    -   SAVI: Suitable for areas with sparse vegetation
-   **Water Indices**:
    -   NDWI = (Green-NIR)/(Green+NIR): Extracts water bodies
    -   MNDWI: Improved version, reduces building interference
-   **Built-up Indices**:
    -   NDBI = (SWIR-NIR)/(SWIR+NIR): Highlights urban built-up areas
-   **Other Thematic Indices**:
    -   Soil indices, snow cover indices, drought indices, etc.

### Image Classification Methods

-   **Supervised Classification**:
    -   Requires training samples of known categories
    -   Algorithms: Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Deep Learning
    -   Advantages: High accuracy, strong controllability
-   **Unsupervised Classification**:
    -   Automatic clustering, no prior knowledge needed
    -   Algorithms: K-means, ISODATA
    -   Advantages: Fast, suitable for preliminary analysis of unknown areas
-   **Object-Based Classification**:
    -   Segment first, then classify based on homogeneous regions
    -   Considers shape, texture, contextual relationships
    -   Suitable for high-resolution image analysis

### Accuracy Assessment

-   **Error Matrix**: Compares predicted categories with reference data
-   **Evaluation Metrics**:
    -   Overall Accuracy: Total proportion correctly classified
    -   User's Accuracy: Reliability of a classified category (reduces misclassification)
    -   Producer's Accuracy: Completeness of an actual category (reduces omission)
    -   Kappa Coefficient: Accounts for the possibility of random correctness

### Change Detection Techniques

-   **Image Differencing**: Direct calculation of multi-temporal image differences
-   **Ratio Analysis**: Calculates before/after ratios, reduces illumination effects
-   **Post-Classification Comparison**: Compares classification results from different periods
-   **Change Vector Analysis**: Direction and magnitude of changes across multiple bands

## Applications

Atmospheric correction (AC) is essential in ocean colour (OC) remote sensing, as errors can significantly affect water reflectance retrieval. Ilori et al. [-@ilori2019analyzing] evaluated four AC methods for Landsat 8 OLI: ARCSI, ACOLITE, LaSRC, and SeaDAS.

The study found that ARCSI and LaSRC, designed for land applications, performed poorly over coastal waters, especially in the blue bands (e.g., 443 nm). In contrast, ACOLITE and SeaDAS, optimized for aquatic environments, provided better accuracy. Among them, SeaDAS outperformed ACOLITE, particularly in complex waters, with lower root-mean-square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.0013 sr⁻¹ (443 nm) to 0.0005 sr⁻¹ (655 nm). Additionally, solar zenith angle and wind speed significantly affected AC errors for ACOLITE and SeaDAS in the 443 nm and 482 nm bands.

These findings are crucial for selecting appropriate AC methods for coastal and inland water monitoring, improving the accuracy of water quality assessments, pollution detection, and climate studies. Further research is needed to validate AC methods in inland and optically complex waters. As remote sensing advances, refining AC algorithms will be essential for enhancing the accuracy of high-resolution sensors like Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2.

## Reflection

Learning about remote sensing data processing has fundamentally changed my understanding of geospatial analysis. I now understand that raw data contains numerous distortions and artifacts that must be systematically addressed before meaningful analysis can begin. This realization has instilled in me a deeper appreciation for the rigorous preprocessing required for reliable results.

The systematic approach to data correction – from geometric to atmospheric to radiometric – mirrors the scientific method itself, requiring both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. I found myself particularly intrigued by the trade-offs involved in selecting correction methods. The choice between simplicity (like Dark Object Subtraction) and sophistication (like radiative transfer models) mirrors decisions I'll need to make in my own research, balancing accuracy requirements against available resources and expertise.

This lecture has also highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of remote sensing. The physics of atmospheric scattering, the mathematics of transformation matrices, the computer science of image processing, and the domain knowledge required for interpretation all converge in this field. As someone interested in environmental applications, I now see how essential these technical preprocessing steps are for generating trustworthy analyses that can inform policy and management decisions.
