    "text": "3.2 Applications\nAtmospheric correction (AC) is essential in ocean colour (OC) remote sensing, as errors can significantly affect water reflectance retrieval. Ilori et al. (2019) evaluated four AC methods for Landsat 8 OLI: ARCSI, ACOLITE, LaSRC, and SeaDAS.\nThe study found that ARCSI and LaSRC, designed for land applications, performed poorly over coastal waters, especially in the blue bands (e.g., 443 nm). In contrast, ACOLITE and SeaDAS, optimized for aquatic environments, provided better accuracy. Among them, SeaDAS outperformed ACOLITE, particularly in complex waters, with lower root-mean-square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.0013 sr⁻¹ (443 nm) to 0.0005 sr⁻¹ (655 nm). Additionally, solar zenith angle and wind speed significantly affected AC errors for ACOLITE and SeaDAS in the 443 nm and 482 nm bands.\nThese findings are crucial for selecting appropriate AC methods for coastal and inland water monitoring, improving the accuracy of water quality assessments, pollution detection, and climate studies. Further research is needed to validate AC methods in inland and optically complex waters. As remote sensing advances, refining AC algorithms will be essential for enhancing the accuracy of high-resolution sensors like Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2.",

    "text": "3.3 Reflection\nLearning about remote sensing data processing has fundamentally changed my understanding of geospatial analysis. I now understand that raw data contains numerous distortions and artifacts that must be systematically addressed before meaningful analysis can begin. This realization has instilled in me a deeper appreciation for the rigorous preprocessing required for reliable results.\nThe systematic approach to data correction – from geometric to atmospheric to radiometric – mirrors the scientific method itself, requiring both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. I found myself particularly intrigued by the trade-offs involved in selecting correction methods. The choice between simplicity (like Dark Object Subtraction) and sophistication (like radiative transfer models) mirrors decisions I’ll need to make in my own research, balancing accuracy requirements against available resources and expertise.\nThis lecture has also highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of remote sensing. The physics of atmospheric scattering, the mathematics of transformation matrices, the computer science of image processing, and the domain knowledge required for interpretation all converge in this field. As someone interested in environmental applications, I now see how essential these technical preprocessing steps are for generating trustworthy analyses that can inform policy and management decisions.",
