# Getting started with Remote sensing

## Summary

### What is Remote Sensing?

-   Remote sensing is basically a way of collecting information about places or objects without physically being there.

-   It works by detecting energy (usually light or heat) that bounces off the Earth’s surface.

-   Think of it like taking a photo from space, but with more than just visible light—some sensors can see heat, detect moisture, or even see through clouds!

### Types of Remote Sensing

-   Passive sensing → Relies on sunlight (like a regular camera, human eyes, satellite sensor).

-   Active sensing → Sends out its own signals and measures the response (like radar or LiDAR).

### Electromagnetic Radiation

-   Remote sensing works by detecting electromagnetic radiation (EMR), which includes visible light, infrared, and other types of waves.

-   Different surfaces reflect and absorb EMR differently, so we can use this to identify and analyze objects from a distance.

-   Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum：

### Resolution – How clear is the Image?

-   Spatial resolution – How detailed an image is (higher resolution = smaller objects visible).

-   Temporal resolution – How often images are taken (e.g., some satellites scan daily, others every few weeks).

-   Spectral resolution – How many “colors” or wavelengths are detected (more bands = more data about the environment).

-   Radiometric resolution – How precisely differences in energy levels are recorded (higher bit depth = more subtle variations detected).

## Applications

In environmental monitoring, satellite remote sensing has emerged as a cornerstone technology for tracking deforestation[@lima2019comparing], land-use changes [@frimpong2021tracking], and ecological degradation. The synergistic use of Sentinel-2 and Landsat systems exemplifies the unique value of multi-scale Earth observation data in ecological governance. The following are two different examples.

-   Monitoring of Selective Logging in Tropical Forests

Lima et al.'s [-@lima2019comparing] groundbreaking study on selective logging in the Brazilian Amazon employed a self-referenced Normalized Burn Ratio index through time-series analysis, revealing a critical paradox: while Sentinel-2's 10-meter resolution better detected logging infrastructure (43.2% detection rate vs Landsat 8's 35.5%), Landsat 8 captured 36.9% more disturbed area. This counterintuitive finding stems from Landsat's broader spectral range enhancing sub-canopy disturbance sensitivity, whereas Sentinel-2's high resolution, despite its precision, becomes susceptible to canopy gap interference. The study's innovative 300m assessment grid design effectively addressed mixed-pixel challenges while aligning with local forestry management units, a methodology subsequently adopted by Brazil's environmental agency for illegal logging early-warning systems.

-   Urban Expansion Analysis of Kumasi, Ghana

Frimpong and Molkenthin's [-@frimpong2021tracking] longitudinal study of Kumasi, Ghana demonstrates remote sensing's urban planning applications. By processing 1986-2015 Landsat imagery with Random Forest algorithms, the research not only quantified the city's explosive growth from 23.78% (1986) to 72.05% (2015) urban coverage but also, through density decay curves, revealed spatial heterogeneity in expansion patterns - particularly an alarming 79.7% agricultural land conversion rate in peri-urban zones. The deliberate selection of Landsat over higher-resolution data proved strategic: 30-meter resolution adequately captured West Africa's characteristic clustered urban expansion patterns while leveraging Landsat's unparalleled 40-year archive for longitudinal analysis.

## Reflection

This lecture provided a clear introduction to remote sensing.It made me have a general idea of how satellite imagery works, and let me realize how different types of resolution determine what kind of information can be extracted. For example, high temporal resolution is essential for disaster monitoring, while high spectral resolution is better suited for analyzing vegetation health. Understanding these differences helped me see why different satellites are designed for specific applications.

One of the most interesting aspects was learning about the wide range of applications. I was aware that remote sensing is used for weather forecasting and mapping, but I hadn’t considered its role in agriculture, urban planning, and security. It was fascinating to see how thermal infrared sensors detect wildfires in real-time, how radar satellites track floods through cloud cover, and how spectral data can reveal plant stress before it’s visible.

I’m now curious about how satellite data is processed and analyzed. The raw images must be converted into meaningful insights, often using GIS and machine learning techniques. Moving forward, I want to learn more about the analytical side of remote sensing and how it connects with my research interests.
