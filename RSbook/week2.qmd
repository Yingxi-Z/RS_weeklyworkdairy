# Getting started with Remote sensing

## 1. Summary

### 1.1 What is Remote Sensing?

-   Remote sensing is basically a way of collecting information about places or objects without physically being there.

-   It works by detecting energy (usually light or heat) that bounces off the Earth’s surface.

-   Think of it like taking a photo from space, but with more than just visible light—some sensors can see heat, detect moisture, or even see through clouds!

### 1.2 Types of Remote Sensing

-   Passive sensing → Relies on sunlight (like a regular camera, human eyes, satellite sensor).

-   Active sensing → Sends out its own signals and measures the response (like radar or LiDAR).
