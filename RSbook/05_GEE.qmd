# Google Earth Engine

## Summary

Lecture 5 introduced Google Earth Engine (GEE), a powerful cloud computing platform designed for processing and analyzing geospatial data, particularly remote sensing data. GEE integrates vast geospatial datasets with strong computational capabilities, enabling users to efficiently process and analyze large-scale data.

### Advantages of GEE

Data Storage and Access: Users can access and process data directly in the cloud without downloading large datasets, saving local storage space and improving efficiency.

Computational Power: Leveraging Google’s robust infrastructure, GEE can handle large-scale data processing, supporting complex analyses and significantly reducing processing time.

Programming Interface: GEE offers both JavaScript and Python APIs, allowing users to customize analysis workflows as needed. This flexibility makes it suitable for various applications.

### Key Functions in GEE

Image Processing: Functions like ee.Image allow users to manipulate and analyze satellite images, such as applying filters, enhancing contrast, and extracting spectral indices (e.g., NDVI for vegetation analysis).

Data Collection and Filtering: ee.ImageCollection enables users to work with large datasets, filtering by date, location, or cloud cover.

Geospatial Statistics: ee.Reducer functions help compute statistical summaries (e.g., mean, median, min/max values) for specific regions.

Vector Data Processing: ee.Geometry and ee.FeatureCollection handle vector data like points, lines, and polygons for spatial analysis.

### Essential Tools in GEE

Code Editor: A powerful web-based IDE that allows users to write JavaScript scripts, visualize data, and execute computations.

Asset Manager: Users can upload and manage their own datasets, such as shapefiles or raster images.

Data Catalog: GEE provides access to extensive remote sensing and geospatial datasets, including Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, and global climate models.

Map Visualization Tools: Users can overlay processed images, vector data, and computed results onto interactive maps.

## Applications

Google Earth Engine (GEE) has emerged as a transformative platform for large-scale environmental monitoring.

Farhadi et al.[-@farhadi2025introducing] developed an innovative Spectral Flood Mapping Index (SFMI) using Sentinel-2 imagery within GEE, enabling automated flood detection at 10-meter resolution. Their approach leverages GEE's cloud computing power to process multi-temporal data and integrate spectral indices (NDWI, NDVI) through Otsu's thresholding method, significantly reducing processing time compared to traditional workflows. This application is particularly valuable for disaster response, where rapid flood mapping can inform emergency operations within hours of data acquisition.

For long-term ecological assessment, Liu et al. [-@liu2023analysis] utilized GEE to analyze 40 years of Landsat imagery (1985-2022) for vegetation monitoring on Zhoushan Island. The platform's ability to process over 5,000 Landsat scenes enabled comprehensive NDVI trend analysis, revealing a 13% decline in coastal vegetation. By incorporating spatial statistics (Moran's I) and multivariate analysis of climate, terrain, and anthropogenic factors, the study demonstrated GEE's capacity for complex geospatial modeling at regional scales.

## Reflection

I found this session particularly insightful because it demonstrated how large-scale geospatial analysis can be conducted efficiently without requiring high-end hardware. The ability to access and process vast datasets in the cloud is a significant advantage, especially for environmental research, urban planning, and disaster management.

One key takeaway for me was how GEE integrates various datasets, such as Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS, into a single platform. This makes it much easier to analyze long-term environmental changes without having to manually collect and preprocess data. The fact that GEE provides pre-processed and ready-to-use datasets greatly simplifies geospatial analysis, which is particularly beneficial for beginners like me.

However, I also found the learning curve to be somewhat challenging. Unlike traditional GIS software, which often has a graphical user interface, GEE requires scripting in JavaScript or Python. Since I have limited programming experience, writing scripts to filter datasets and visualize results was initially difficult. So this lecture really motivated me to improve my scripting abilities.
