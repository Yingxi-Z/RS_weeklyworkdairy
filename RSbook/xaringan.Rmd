## Introduction: What is Sentinel-1 SAR?

- **Sentinel-1** is a satellite mission under the **Copernicus Programme** (ESA)
- Uses **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** for high-resolution Earth imaging
- **Key Benefits:**
  - Works in **all weather conditions** (unlike optical satellites)
  - Useful for **disaster response, urban planning, and environmental monitoring**
  - Detects **flooding, land deformation, and deforestation**
---

## Technical Overview

- **SAR Imaging Principle:** Active microwave sensor transmitting signals and analyzing return waves
- **Sentinel-1A & 1B:** Launched in **2014 & 2016**
- **Spatial Resolution:** ~5m x 20m (Interferometric Wide Swath Mode)
- **Revisit Time:** 6–12 days (global coverage)

---

## Application 1: Flood Monitoring & Disaster Management

- **Case Study:** Sentinel-1 SAR mapped the **2021 Henan Floods (China)**
- **How?** Detects water-covered areas by identifying changes in surface backscatter
- **Impact:**
  - Provided real-time flood extent data for emergency response
  - Unlike optical satellites, SAR works even during storms & at night

---

## Application 2: Urban Growth & Land Subsidence

- **Case Study:** Sentinel-1 SAR tracked urban sprawl & land subsidence in **Jakarta**
- **Method:** Interferometric SAR (InSAR) to measure ground movement
- **Findings:** Jakarta is sinking **10-20 cm per year** due to groundwater extraction
- **Urban Impact:** Helps policymakers tackle **sinking cities**

---

## Challenges & Limitations

- **Complex Data Processing:** Requires expertise in **GIS & Machine Learning**
- **Resolution Trade-Off:** Not as detailed as LiDAR for small-scale studies
- **Interference Issues:** Surface roughness & vegetation can affect accuracy

---

## Reflection: Insights & Future Applications

- **Personal Insight:** SAR’s ability to **see through clouds & work at night** makes it vital for disaster response
- **Future Use Cases:**
  - Integration of **Sentinel-1 SAR with deep learning** for real-time flood mapping
  - Potential in **Manchester flooding studies** (relevant to your research!)
  - Long-term urban growth monitoring for **sustainable city planning**

---

## Conclusion

- **Why Sentinel-1 SAR matters:** Flood detection, urban growth analysis, and disaster management
- **Final Thought:** SAR technology will continue evolving, playing a vital role in **climate resilience & smart cities**
