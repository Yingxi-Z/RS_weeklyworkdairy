### 1.SAR fundamentals
SAR:
Different surfaces respond differently to the polarizations
A SAR signal has both amplitude (backscatter) and phase data.
different weather show different signal: windy day-the surface of the water is rough

InSAR: combine two or more SAR image
DInSAR: remove the effet of natural elevtation (DSM/DEM/DTM)

### 2. GEE SAR
SAR data values:
identify changes: 
substract image is not suitable for SAR 
Ratio images: IR(improved ratio);mean; log; IRL(improved log ratio)
which is best and how to test them?
