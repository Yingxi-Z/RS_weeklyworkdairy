# SAR

## Summary

### Technical Characteristics

SAR is an active remote sensing sensor that simultaneously records two critical types of data:

-   Amplitude (backscatter)

-   Phase data (wave cycle location)

### Key Analytical Considerations

1.  Polarization

    -   Different polarizations (e.g., VV) reveal surface roughness characteristics

    -   Provides insights into surface material properties

2.  Permativity (Dielectric Constant)

    -   Indicates the material's reflectivity back to the sensor

    -   Varies across different surface types

    -   Water tends to reflect signals away from the sensor

3.  Wavelength

-   Different bands provide varied surface interaction information

## Data Representation in Google Earth Engine

-   Limited to amplitude (backscatter) data

-   Three primary data units:

    1.  Power scale: Raw SAR data for statistical analysis

    2.  Amplitude: Visualization purposes

    3.  Decibel (dB) scale: Highlighting differences (default in GEE)

### Unique Advantages and Analysis Techniques

#### Distinctive Sensor Capabilities

-   Penetrates cloud cover
-   Operates independently of optical sensor limitations

#### Analysis Methods

1.  Change Detection

    -   Comparing images using ratio or log ratio techniques

2.  Temporal Analysis

    -   T-tests

    -   Standard deviation calculations

    -   Exploring variance over time

3.  Data Fusion Techniques

    -   Principal Component Analysis

    -   Object-Based Image Analysis

    -   Intensity fusion with optical data

#### 1.SAR fundamentals

SAR: Different surfaces respond differently to the polarizations A SAR signal has both amplitude (backscatter) and phase data. different weather show different signal: windy day-the surface of the water is rough

InSAR: combine two or more SAR image DInSAR: remove the effet of natural elevtation (DSM/DEM/DTM)

### 2. GEE SAR

SAR data values: identify changes: substract image is not suitable for SAR Ratio images: IR(improved ratio);mean; log; IRL(improved log ratio) which is best and how to test them?

## Applications

### Agricultural Monitoring and Crop Management

SAR technology offers unprecedented capabilities in agricultural research and monitoring. Unlike optical sensors constrained by cloud cover and daylight limitations, SAR can consistently track agricultural landscapes throughout the year. By analyzing backscatter signals, researchers can extract critical information about crop health, growth stages, and land use patterns.

The technology enables precise monitoring of crop conditions by detecting changes in surface roughness and moisture content. Different polarization modes allow scientists to distinguish between various crop types, assess vegetation density, and predict potential yield. For instance, winter wheat fields exhibit distinct backscatter signatures during different growth stages, enabling early detection of potential crop stress or disease.

Flood and moisture mapping represent another crucial agricultural application. SAR's ability to penetrate cloud cover and measure surface moisture makes it invaluable for tracking potential agricultural risks. Farmers and policymakers can use these insights to predict irrigation needs, assess flood damage, and develop more resilient agricultural strategies.

### Disaster Risk and Environmental Management

In disaster management, SAR provides critical real-time monitoring capabilities that traditional remote sensing techniques cannot match. The technology's ability to generate consistent imagery through adverse weather conditions makes it exceptionally valuable for tracking dynamic environmental changes.

Earthquake and landslide risk assessment benefit significantly from SAR interferometry. By comparing multiple SAR images of the same location over time, researchers can detect minute ground surface movements as small as millimeters. This capability allows for early warning systems in tectonically active regions, potentially saving lives and mitigating infrastructure damage.

Additionally, SAR plays a crucial role in monitoring environmental phenomena like deforestation, urban expansion, and coastal changes. Its capacity to provide detailed surface information regardless of atmospheric conditions enables comprehensive environmental surveillance. Scientists can track forest cover changes, monitor sea-level rise, and assess infrastructure development with unprecedented precision.

## Reflection

Before this lecture, I already had a general understanding of **how SAR works**, but my knowledge was mostly theoretical. What I hadn’t fully grasped were its **practical advantages for flood detection** and the specific **data processing techniques** required to extract meaningful insights. The lecture clarified why SAR is so effective in flood monitoring—not just because of its **cloud-penetrating ability**, but also due to its **sensitivity to surface water through backscatter variations**. I found the discussion on **VV vs. VH polarization** particularly useful, as it explained why VV polarization is more responsive to open water, influencing how we selected data for our group project.

Initially, our approach to **flood detection in Manchester** was centered on optical data. While we were aware of SAR’s potential, we hadn’t fully considered the practical challenges of working with **speckle noise and change detection methods**. The lecture introduced us to techniques like the **Improved Log Ratio (IRL)**, which proved more effective than simple subtraction when analyzing flood extent. Another key takeaway was how **dielectric properties influence SAR backscatter**, helping us interpret unexpected patterns, such as **higher returns from flooded vegetation** due to double-bounce effects.

Moving forward, I see value in integrating **SAR and optical data** for a more comprehensive flood analysis and potentially incorporating **InSAR techniques to monitor flood-induced land deformation**. The lecture not only refined our group project’s methodology but also deepened my appreciation for the complexities of **SAR data processing** in real-world applications.
